= How to install

This application is a python package.
You can use `pip` to install it directly from github:
[source, sh]
----
$ pip install https://github.com/igsha/instafs/tarball/master
----

Another option is to use https://nixos.org/guides/install-nix.html[nix]:
[source, sh]

= How to use

== Mount

Like any fuse-based filesystem instafs should be started as
[source, sh]
----
$ instafs -u <user> /mount/point
----

.Parameters
<user>:: Account name to mount.
/mount/point:: A folder where the program should mount account data.

== Working with mount point

Now the chosen account is mounted as ordinary folder in the mount point.
You can list its content and watch images/video.

Each post is a folder with

* media data: jpeg images or mp4 video files;
* `caption.txt` file with the given caption;
* `info.json` that contains service information;
* the folder name is a sequence number within the account;
* the files timestamps are the real creation time of the post.

The root folder of an account contains

* initial posts (12 items);
* special `next` folder that contains the next 12 posts;
* `biography.txt` file with the description of the account;
* `user.json` is a service information of the mounted account.

Example for the `instagram` account:
[source, sh]
